Dataset Taken from Kaggle

The primary objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of global CO2 emissions using the provided dataset (1750-2020). This analysis aims to achieve the following specific goals:

Quantify and visualize historical CO2 emission trends: To understand the evolution of CO2 emissions over time, both globally and at the country level.

Investigate the relationship between CO2 emissions and influencing factors: To explore how factors such as population, geographical area, and historical development correlate with CO2 emission levels.

Apply machine learning for predictive insights: To build a model that can help understand the drivers of CO2 emissions and potentially provide insights for future scenarios.
